# WhatsApp Infinite Loading
## Description
This script is designed to keep the WhatsApp application in a perpetual loading state, preventing unauthorized access to your account while you're away from your device.

## How It Works
The script constantly simulates a loading activity on WhatsApp, making the application appear to be indefinitely loading. This makes it difficult for others to access your conversations while the device is unlocked.

## Attention
This script is intended solely for personal security purposes and should not be used to harm or violate the privacy of others.
